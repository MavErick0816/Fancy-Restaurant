Restaurant is a simulation of the interaction between a customer and a waiter.

The goal of this project was to create a code that would be able to accept input from the user and create a corresponding output. In this case, the inputs are the answers to a series of questions that are asked by the program/waiter and the outputs are the responses or questions asked to the user/customer. We made this possible through the use of Java and using the IDE Inteliji. We were given about 2 months to bring our idea to life. The communication process was made possible through the use of Github where we were able to share the code we worked on and build upon each other's work. This allowed for a smooth process and the success of our project.

Included in this GitHub, you will find our code in a .java file located under "Restaurant.java". This should be the easiest way to download and run our program. If this doesn't work, we have also included the code in text format for you to copy and paste into whatever IDE you choose. 

INSTRUCTIONS

Once the program is running you should first run into this text.

This is our menu of food options to choose from. Enter the number of the item that you would like to order. You will then be asked if that is the end of your order.

If you choose no, then you can enter another food item to be added to your tab. The program will keep taking your order until you enter Yes (meaning that will be all).

Your full order and total price will be printed out and you will be asked what way you will be paying. Should you be paying with card, you will "pay" and then be wished a Good Day.
