Fancy Restaurant is a simulation between you a customer and a waiter.

This goal of this project was to create a code that would be able to accept input from the user and create a corresponding output. In this case, the inputs are the answers to a series of questions that are asked by the porgram and the outputs were the responses or questions asked to the user. We made this possible through the use of Java and using the IDE Inteliji. We were given about 2 months to bring out idea to life. The communication process was made possible through the use of Github where we were able to share the code we worked on and build upon eachother. This led to a smooth process and the success of out project.
