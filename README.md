Fancy Restaurant is a simulation between you a customer and a waiter.

This goal of this project was to create a code that would be able to accept input from the user and create a corresponding output. In this case, the inputs are the answers to a series of questions that are asked by the program and the outputs are the responses or questions asked to the user. We made this possible through the use of Java and using the IDE Inteliji. We were given about 2 months to bring our idea to life. The communication process was made possible through the use of Github where we were able to share the code we worked on and build upon each other's work. This led to a smooth process and the success of our project.

Included in this GitHub, you will find our code in a .java file located under "Restaurant.java". This should be the easiest way to download and run our program. If this doesn't work, we have also included the code in text format for you to copy and paste into whatever IDE you choose. Once the program is running you should first run into this text.
